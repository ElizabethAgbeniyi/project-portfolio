<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Agbeniyi, I am a Registered Nurse who is passionate about Web3 and Tech.
  This interest has led me to embark on the journey of being a content creator, as well as starting a course on becoming a full stack web developer.
</p>

<p>Since I got this conviction, I purchased an online course by Dr Angela on Udemy.
  It has been an exciting journey and part of the task is creaing a Portfolio website, based on what we have learnt so far on html.
</p>

<p>My expectations at the end of this course is to become a skilled full stack web developer, and learn Rust programming language.
  This will enable the opportunity to build on Polkadot's SDK.
